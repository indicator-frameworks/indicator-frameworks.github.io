## Indicator Frameworks

An indicator is just a column of data, typically persistent over time and coming from a stable source or set of sources.

Indicator frameworks are just sets of indicators. They have three main uses: (1) to communicate quantitative information and strategic priorities to a wide audience, (2) to enable policy reactions to data, especially in the optimization of processes, and (3) to restrict a ention to a set of ‘relevant’ indicators—thus discarding the information from many other, ‘non-relevant’ indicators.

### What we do

Our idea: instead of constructing indicator frameworks expensively and internally, meaning indicator-by-indicator, we can specify them abstractly and externally, by means of their causal and statistical relationships to other, already-extant sets of indicators. Our approach is especially suited to situations where heterogeneous data is distributed across many projects and many localities.

The indicator frameworks research team conducts original scientific research on indicator frameworks, and works to disseminate our findings to the smart cities community.
