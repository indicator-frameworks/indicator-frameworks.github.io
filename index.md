## Indicator Frameworks

An indicator is just a column of data, typically persistent over time and coming from a stable source or set of sources.

Indicator frameworks are just sets of indicators. Every dashboard, every BI tool, and every performance measurement framework (like [CITYKeys](http://www.citykeys-project.eu/citykeys/home) or [ISO 37120](https://www.iso.org/standard/62436.html)) is an example of an indicator framework. They have three main uses: (1) to communicate quantitative information and strategic priorities to a wide audience, (2) to enable policy reactions to data, especially in the optimization of processes, and (3) to restrict a ention to a set of ‘relevant’ indicators—thus discarding the information from many other, ‘non-relevant’ indicators.

Indicator frameworks are among the simplest examples of *scientific models based on data*. Our research looks at the foundations of these models, with an eye toward enriching and automating the process of constructing real-world frameworks for cities and the organizations that serve them.

### What we do

Our idea: instead of constructing indicator frameworks expensively and internally, meaning indicator-by-indicator, we can specify them abstractly and externally, by means of their causal and statistical relationships to other, already-extant sets of indicators. Our approach is especially suited to situations where heterogeneous data is distributed across many projects and many localities.

More technically: data is most valuable when it is *joined* with other data, but how do we join and compare data from disparate, non-overlapping sources? We can do so "under a model".

The indicator frameworks research team conducts original scientific research on indicator frameworks, and works to disseminate our findings to the smart cities community.
